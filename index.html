      <h1 align="center" font="aclonica">About Me</h1>
      <p align="center">
        I am currently a graduate student at the Université de Montréal studying Extra-Galactic Astrophysics. On this site you will
        be able to find my current and past projects as well as relevant information about me! My wife, Catherine, and I live
        in the old port of Montréal with our two adorable cats (plenty of photos to come!). We love skating and strolling
        around historic Montréal. In addition to studying Astronomy at UdeM (l'Université de Montréal), I study French and Russian.

      <p>
          Culminating in a poster at the annual ESA conference on the extremes of black hole accretion in Madrid, Spain in conjunction with several colloquium talks,
          a presentation at a conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,  and paper entitled Gravitational Lensing Size Scales for Quasars,
          my undergraduate studies in both astronomy and pure math served me thoroughly during my first stint at as graduate student at Duke University in computational mechanics and scientific computing.
          After finishing my master’s thesis, I returned to astrophysics by joining Dr. Julie Hlavacek-larrondo’s high-energy astrophysics team at l’Université de Montréal. Emerging myself in the astronomy life in Montreal,
          I participate in the astronomy on tap events as both a volunteer and a speaker, attend inter-university seminars, and have taken advantage of several evenings at the Observatory at Mont Megantic.
